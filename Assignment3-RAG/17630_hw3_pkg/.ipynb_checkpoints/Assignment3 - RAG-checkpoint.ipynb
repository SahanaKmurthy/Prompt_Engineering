    "## Assignment3 - Retrieval Augmented Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this asignment, you will develop a RAG solution to answer questions about a repository of research papers. The assignment requires you to parse the paper PDF files, chunk and index the data, and then design and execute an evaluation of the retriever results. In Naïve RAG, the query is compared to documents in the vector database for retrieval of the top N documents that match the query. The language model is then used to summarize the retrieved documents into an answer to the user query. Research papers are highly structured documents with technically deep content, in contrast to blogs, which contain more general and introductory content. This means that queries may be unlikely to match relevant chunks of the paper without additional processing, such as information extraction or summarization.\n",
    "\n",
    "One approach to address this problem is to use the language model to generate answerable questions from chunks of each paper. The generated questions can then be indexed as \"documents\" in a vector database, and the user query can be matched against the most similar questions. By maintaining a mapping between the indexed, generated question and the paper chunk, the retrieval process can then produce the most relevant chunks for use in summarizing an answer to the user query."

In this pa-\\nper, we show that strong performance can be\\nachieved by a method we call ITER -RETGEN,\\nwhich synergizes retrieval and generation in an\\niterative manner: a model’s response to a task\\ninput shows what might be needed to finish\\nthe task, and thus can serve as an informative\\ncontext for retrieving more relevant knowledge\\nwhich in turn helps generate a better response\\nin another iteration. Compared with recent\\nwork which interleaves retrieval with gener-\\nation when completing a single output, I TER -\\nRETGEN processes all retrieved knowledge as\\na whole and largely preserves the flexibility in\\ngeneration without structural constraints. We\\nevaluate ITER -RETGEN on multi-hop question\\nanswering, fact verification, and commonsense\\nreasoning, and show that it can flexibly lever-\\nage parametric knowledge and non-parametric\\nknowledge, and is superior to or competitive\\nwith state-of-the-art retrieval-augmented base-\\nlines while causing fewer overheads of retrieval\\nand generation. We can further improve per-\\nformance via generation-augmented retrieval\\nadaptation. 1 Introduction\\nGenerative Large Language Models (LLMs)\\nhave powered numerous applications, with well-\\nperceived utility.'}]\n"

      "Query: What is RAG?\n",
      "Generated Answer: RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation, which is a methodology that enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating knowledge from external databases. This approach aims to improve the accuracy and credibility of generated responses, particularly for knowledge-intensive tasks, by retrieving relevant document chunks through semantic similarity calculations. RAG effectively reduces issues like hallucinations and outdated knowledge by referencing external information, allowing for continuous knowledge updates and integration of domain-specific content. The RAG framework includes three main components: retrieval, generation, and augmentation.\n",
      "Ground Truth: RAG stands for Retrieval Augmented Generation. It is a method used in large language models (LLMs) that retrieves relevant information based on a query and then prompts an LLM to generate a response in the context of the retrieved information. This approach helps expand the LLM's access to vast amounts of information efficiently.\n",

      "Final retrieved chunk IDs: [483, 488, 476]\n",
      "Query: What are the different ways to chunk documents for RAG?\n",
      "Generated Answer: The different ways to chunk documents for RAG include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Fixed Number of Tokens**: The most common method is to split the document into chunks based on a fixed number of tokens (e.g., 100, 256, 512). Larger chunks can capture more context but may generate more noise, while smaller chunks may not fully convey the necessary context but produce less noise.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Recursive Splits and Sliding Window Methods**: These methods enable layered retrieval by merging globally related information across multiple retrieval processes, although they still struggle to balance semantic completeness and context length.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Small2Big Method**: This approach uses sentences (small) as the retrieval unit, providing preceding and following sentences as (big) context to the LLMs.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Metadata Attachments**: Chunks can be enriched with metadata information such as page number, file name, author, category, and timestamp to enhance their utility.\n",
      "\n",
      "These chunking strategies aim to optimize the retrieval process and improve the performance of RAG systems.\n",

      "Final retrieved chunk IDs: [3893, 2844, 3882]\n",
      "Query: What are the different metrics for evaluating a RAG system?\n",
      "Generated Answer: The context does not specify the exact metrics used for evaluating a RAG system. It mentions that the RAGA S framework provides a suite of metrics to evaluate different dimensions of RAG architectures, such as the ability of the retrieval system to identify relevant context passages, the ability of the LLM to exploit such passages in a faithful way, and the quality of the generation itself. However, it does not detail these specific metrics. \n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the answer is IDK.\n",
      "Ground Truth: The different metrics for evaluating a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system include context relevance, answer faithfulness and answer relevance. Additional metrics mentioned in the text for evaluating the retrieval and generation aspects include Accuracy, EM (Exact Match), Recall, Precision, R-Rate, Cosine Similarity, Hit Rate, MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank), NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain), BLEU, and ROUGE/ROUGE-L.\n",

      "Final retrieved chunk IDs: [380, 370, 390]\n",
      "Query: What are main contributions of RAG research?\n",
      "Generated Answer: The main contributions of RAG research include the development of three stages of RAG (Naive RAG, Advanced RAG, and Modular RAG), improvements in retrieval quality through pre-retrieval and post-retrieval strategies, optimization methods for indexing and query processes, and the integration of external knowledge sources to enhance the context provided to language models. RAG also addresses limitations faced by traditional models, such as retrieval challenges, generation difficulties, and augmentation hurdles, thereby improving the overall effectiveness of language model responses. Additionally, RAG research explores the synergy between retrieval, generation, and augmentation processes, helping to form a cohesive RAG framework.\n",
      "Ground Truth: The main contributions of RAG research include a thorough and systematic review of state-of-the-art RAG methods, the delineation of its evolution through various paradigms, advancements aimed at improving factual accuracy by providing access to auxiliary information, and exploration of innovative augmentation methodologies and flexible RAG pipelines. Additionally, the research emphasizes the need for domain-specific RAG techniques to enhance performance across various applications.\n",

      "3. **Token Probability Inspection**: One method involves inspecting the probabilities assigned to individual tokens, where we would expect the model to be less confident in hallucinated answers compared to factual ones. For instance, BARTScore estimates factuality by looking at the conditional probability of the generated text given the input.\n",

      "Generated Answer: SELF-ROUTE is a method that combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and long-context (LC) models to reduce computational costs while maintaining performance comparable to LC. It utilizes the LLM itself to route queries based on self-reflection, under the assumption that LLMs are well-calibrated in predicting whether a query is answerable based on the provided context. The method consists of two steps: a RAG-and-Route step, where the LLM predicts if the query is answerable and generates the answer if it is; and a long-context prediction step for queries deemed unanswerable in the first step. This approach allows for substantial reductions in the number of tokens required, leading to cost savings while achieving effective performance.\n",
