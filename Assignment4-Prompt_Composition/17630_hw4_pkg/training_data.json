Most were written by uncelebrated but dearly loved soldiers from barracks, trenches, and flooded foxholes, as well as combat journalists, nurses, and family members on the home front. His rich sample testifies to the universal and poignant themes of love and honor, courage and rage, duty and fear and mortality. A major contribution to the understanding of war and its impact, and a powerful tribute to those undone by it. \n  Our Price: $22.40  You Save: $5.60  (20%)     [IMAGE]  Ghost Soldiers: The Forgotten Epic Story of World War II's Most Dramatic Mission \nby Hampton Sides\n In January 1945, 121 Army Rangers slipped behind enemy lines in the Philippines to liberate 513 comrades--the last survivors of the Bataan Death March--being held in a concentration camp. In Ghost Soldiers, journalist Hampton Sides recounts both the hellish imprisonment as well as that daring rescue. Thrilling from start to finish, his book celebrates the heroism of hundreds of warriors, and brings renewed attention to one of the Rangers' finest hours. \n  Our Price: $19.96  You Save: $4.99  (20%)     [IMAGE]  Conquistadors \nby Michael Wood\n Following in the footsteps of the greatest Spanish adventurers, Michael Wood retraces the path of the conquistadors from Amazonia to Lake Titicaca, and from the deserts of North Mexico to the heights of Machu Picchu. Few stories in history match these conquests for sheer drama, endurance, and distances covered, and Wood's gripping narrative brings them fully to life. The stories in Conquistadors are not only of conquest, heroism, and greed, but of changes in the way we see the world, history and civilization, justice and human rights. --From the publisher\n [IMAGE]More new and notable titles  \n  Our Price: $22.00  You Save: $5.50  (20%)     \nReturn to Top \n\nPaperbacks for Memorial Day[IMAGE]  Nam : The Vietnam War in the Words of the Men and Women Who Fought There \nby Mark Baker\n \n  Our Price: $14.36  You Save: $3.59  (20%)     [IMAGE]  At Dawn We Slept : The Untold Story of Pearl Harbor \nby Gordon William Prange, et al\n \n  Our Price: $16.76  You Save: $4.19  (20%)     [IMAGE]  The Right to Fight: A History of African Americans in the Military \nby Gerald Astor\n \n  Our Price: $14.80  You Save: $3.70  (20%)     [IMAGE]  This Kind of War : The Classic Korean War History (Brassey's Five-Star Paperback Series) \nby T.

O'Donnell\n A pioneering oral historian, Patrick O'Donnell used his Web site, The Drop Zone, to solicit personal histories from individual soldiers willing to share their experiences. The result, Beyond Valor, is a moving and often brutal firsthand look at World War II from the perspective of Rangers and Airborne veterans. In an  interview with Amazon.com , O'Donnell explains the \"hidden war\" behind the official histories and why it's vital that such stories be told before they are lost forever.\n  Our Price: $20.80  You Save: $5.20  (20%)     \nReturn to Top \n\nHistory Bestsellers[IMAGE]  Close to Shore : A True Story of Terror in an Age of Innocence \nby Michael Capuzzo, Mike Capuzzo\n Michael Capuzzo tells the harrowing story of the real-life Jaws that helped inspire Peter Benchley's classic novel (and movie). Modern science now tells us that shark attacks are exceedingly rare and limited to just a few species. Yet they do occur, and one of the most terrifying episodes of fatal attacks occurred near the New Jersey shore in 1916, when a renegade great white shark went on a man-eating spree that left three adults and one boy dead.

Still, the Germans showed no distaste for French wine when they invaded France in 1940. Indeed, among the first acts of the occupying army was to seize great stores of wine, sending tens of thousands of barrels to the Third Reich and ordering the conversion of thousands of hectares of vineyards into war production. Wine and War recounts a fascinating and little-known subplot of World War II. \n  Our Price: $19.20  You Save: $4.80  (20%)     [IMAGE]  An Album of Memories: Personal Histories from the Greatest Generation \nby Tom Brokaw\n The third installment in Tom Brokaw's \"Greatest Generation\" trilogy, An Album of Memories is a collection of letters and photos sent to Brokaw by readers who grew up during the Depression and came of age during World War II.

It shows the value of contract terminations for NNG for the contract year of 1101/03 to 11/01/04 to be $145 million. It also shows that the estimated market value is $95 million.  I think for planning purposes however, we would assume that we would contract for the full value of $145 million either through better pricing analytics, new business development projects and/ or Rate Case reallocation to captive customers.  The biggest risk would be the South end TFF of $12 million which we would have a hard time replacing at a $3 million level.\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSo, depending on your assumptions, 2003 and 2004 could be flat to 2002 margin of $439.1 million -   or, if you take into account  the TFF deterioration, it could be below by $8 to 10 million.  However, this deterioration will be offset by some of the new power plant projects  - in particular \"Pleasant Hill\"  which will bring an incremental $6 million in 2004.  I think you also have to assume that other business development projects will come in to help offset the downsides.\n\nSorry if I rambled a bit too much.

Our settlement allows Dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline, dismisses their Texas lawsuit and extends Enron's right to repurchase until June 30.  We reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring Enron out of bankruptcy.  While we would like to keep Northern Natural, we still have some 9,000 miles of safe, profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses.  \n\nThe settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $10 billion damage claim against Dynegy.  It also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts.  \n\nWe want to see a positive future for the employees working with Northern Natural Gas.  Below is a copy of a message from Stan Horton further explaining this decision to the employees of Enron Transportation Services.\n\nKen\n\n\n\nDear ETS Colleague:\n\nOn Thursday, Enron entered into a settlement over Dynegy's exercise of its option to acquire the Northern Natural Gas pipeline.  The settlement allows Dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while Enron pursues its damage claim against Dynegy.  \n\nIn this respect, Enron Corp. has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of Northern Natural Gas.  Consequently, Enron Corp. has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of Northern Natural Gas to Dynegy, while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved.\n\nThe company has concluded that with this settlement, Enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly, as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court.  For the Northern Natural Gas employees, I believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day-to-day satisfaction of running a valuable, successful business.\n\nBeginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe, reliable and efficient operation of Northern Natural Gas.  \n\nOver many years we have run high quality, cost conscious and profitable businesses in ETS.

Here are my notes.  Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they're simply in chronological order.\n\nThe call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.  Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them.  \n\nSpecific points:\nEES will be a part of the new company.  \nEnron assets will be revalued at closing.  \nThe investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for 'very little' additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE 'has sufficient liquidity', ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.  \nDebt/equity of combined company expected to be <45%.\nBoth companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.  \nChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.  \nWatson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.  \nIn what was termed a \"new approach\", the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.  \nRumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.  Dynegy owed Enron <$50MM.  \nLay says that Enron had other options, 'particularly financial'.\nAll of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks.\nLay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be 'pretty big', but that the companies feel they're able to appropriately value this exposure.\nLay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.  \nLay:  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs.\nDynegy says that 'several' internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there's absolutely nothing else out there.\nDoty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had 'close to a billion' in cash.  \nOsprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing.\nMany of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing.\nWith regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that 'our backs are not against the wall', and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash.\nENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.  \nBBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies.\nMcMahon says 'no comment' to WSJ article indicating that ENE's banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks.\nConsolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing.  EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won't be much integration work required there.  The big integration effort will be ENA.\nWatson says that the 'creative financing' surrounded non-core assets.  Doty adds that, 'frankly', DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model.  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that.\nWatson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by 'Enron's top three executives', who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy's deliberations on proceeding with the merger.\nWatson/Doty said that they're NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron's books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling. \nThe deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron's assets or businesses.  Dynegy's lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a 'blunt instrument' under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron's total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing.\nMcMahon adds that there 'could' be more restatements, but he 'does not expect' there to be more restatements.\nENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list.\nThe merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron.\nEnron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.\nInitial reaction of ratings agencies 'very positive' to combined entities.  \nMcMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized.\nDynegy's earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a '25% haircut' to Enron internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies.\nDoty says that both Enron and Dynegy's books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a 'very very substantial' portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash.\nChevronTexaco's investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco's investment is now at a 'more substantial' discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get 'different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better'.  (No further clarification given).\nWhalley believes that 'we'll retain' the Enron traders and marketers. They're used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are 'very excited' by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that 'to the extent necessary, yes.'\nWatson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today.\nWatson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he's a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.\n\nGive me a call if you'd like me to try to clarify any of these comments.\n\nPatrick Tucker\nx3-3055", "label": "none", "dates": "", "index": 35}, {"email": "From: susan.bailey@enron.com | Subject: Legal\\Credit Meeting -- Tuesday, November 20th | Date: Fri, 16 Nov 2001 14:10:52 -0800 (PST) | Body: All,\n\nThe Legal\\Credit Meeting scheduled for Tuesday, November 20th--HAS BEEN CANCELED\n\nThe next meeting will be held on Tuesday, December 4th.\n\n\nRegards,\nSusan S.

Not for its crass commercialism and forced \nfrivolity, but because it's the season when the food police come out \nwith their wagging fingers and annual tips on how to get through the \nholidays without gaining 10 pounds. You can't pick up a magazine \nwithout finding a list of holiday eating do's and don'ts. Eliminate \nsecond helpings, high-calorie sauces and cookies made with butter, \nthey say. Fill up on vegetable sticks, they say. Good grief. Is your \nfavorite childhood memory of Christmas a carrot stick? I didn't think \nso. Isn't mine, either. A carrot was something you left for Rudolph. \nI have my own list of tips for holiday eating. I assure you, if you \nfollow them, you'll be fat and happy. So what if you don't make it to \nNew Year's? Your pants won't fit anymore, anyway. \n\n1. About those carrot sticks. Avoid them. Anyone who puts carrots on \n   a holiday buffet table knows nothing of the Christmas spirit. In \n   fact, if you see carrots, leave immediately. Go next door, where \n   they're serving rum balls. \n\n2. Drink as much eggnog as you can. And quickly. Like fine \n   single-malt scotch, it's rare. In fact, it's even rarer than \n   single-malt scotch. You can't find it any other time of year but now. \n   So drink up! Who cares that it has 10,000 calories in every sip? It's \n   not as if you're going to turn into an egg- nogaholic or something. \n   It's a treat. Enjoy it. Have one for me. Have two. It's later than \n   you think. It's Christmas! \n\n3. If something comes with gravy, use it. That's the whole point of \n   gravy. Pour it on. Make a volcano out of your mashed potatoes. Fill \n   it with gravy. Eat the volcano. Repeat. \n\n4. As for mashed potatoes, always ask if they're made with skim milk \n   or whole milk. If it's skim, pass. Why bother? It's like buying a \n   sports car with an automatic transmission. \n\n5. Do not have a snack before going to a party in an effort to control \n   your eating. The whole point of going to a Christmas party is to eat \n   other people's food for free. Lots of it. Hello? Remember college? \n\n6. Under no circumstances should you exercise between now and New \n   Year's. You can do that in January when you have nothing else to do. \n   This is the time for long naps, which you'll need after circling the \n   buffet table while carrying a 10-pound plate of food and that vat of \n   eggnog. \n\n7. If you come across something really good at a buffet table, like \n   frosted Christmas cookies in the shape and size of Santa, position \n   yourself near them and don't budge. Have as many as you can before \n   becoming the center of attention. They're like a beautiful pair of \n   shoes. You can't leave them behind. You're not going to see them \n   again. \n\n8. Same for pies. Apple. Pumpkin. Mincemeat. Have a slice of each. \n   Or, if you don't like mincemeat, have two apples and one pumpkin. \n   Always have three. When else do you get to have more than one \n   dessert? Labor Day? \n\n9. Did someone mention fruitcake? Granted, it's loaded with the \n   mandatory celebratory calories, but avoid it at all cost. I mean, \n   have some standards, mate. \n\n10. And one final tip: If you don't feel terrible when you leave the \n    party or get up from the table, you haven't been paying attention. \n    Reread tips. Start over. But hurry! Cookieless January is just \n    around the corner. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis message (including any attachments) contains confidential information intended for a specific individual and purpose, and is protected by law.

Most importantly, we have removed the concept of set-off of obligations of the affiliates of non-defaulting parties.  We have also reinserted the concept of \"Interruptible\" transactions; however, we have clarified that \"Baseload Gas\", \"Multi-Month Gas\" and \"Swing Gas\" transactions shall be firm.\n\nIn addition to the foregoing, we have proposed a number of other amendments which help clarify the representations, obligations and transacting procedures under the agreement.  For example, we have distinguished payment defaults from other failures as events constituting \"Defaults\".\n\nSimilarly, we have amended the confirmation procedures of Article 2 to clarify the mechanics of transacting.  As you saw in our previous comments, Enron Canada wants to clarify that, although the practice is to always send a Confirmation Notice, a transaction is not dependent on a Confirmation Notice.  In addition, the Incremental Blackline includes amendments which eliminate the potential confusion/uncertainty which would arise in the event that Confirmation Notices were issued by both parties.  Section 2.4 has been amended such that only one party confirms the transactions.  In this case, because Enron Canada will be issuing the Confirmation Notices for all Enron Online transactions, we have inserted Enron Canada as the party to issue the Confirmation Notice for all transactions, subject to a three business day review period. \n\nShould you have any questions or concerns relating to our proposed changes prior to the meeting, please give me a call.

Most of the imputed income items relates to UK taxes ($220,000), which will be available for use as a credit against any US liability that you have.  $82,000 of the imputed items relates to housing, which also gets exluded under section 911 of the IRS code.  The housing exclusion is in addition to your usual income exclusion.  \n\nIn addition to the payments that have been made and amounts imputed, Enron still intends to tax equalize you for 2001.  \n\nThe $57,000 is the US FIT that has been paid to the IRS on your behalf.  Regarding your UK taxes, Madeline Fox is working to finalize the information for all the expats in the UK.  \n\nRegarding PwC, they probably only meant that they are done with the tax returns for Enron's expats for this year.

CONGRATULATIONS!! (details please, at your earliest chance)\n\nRegarding the Wharton e-Business Initiative (see below for one of the many eMails I've received concerning Enron's participation--link to the referenced web site for specific agenda; also, I've received several voice messages from leaders of the effort).  The information below discusses one of the  forums (coming up 5/31-6/1) that comprise an on-going e-business initiative in which Enron has invested with Wharton.\n\n The participants from Wharton include senior level professors; while there may be some student involvement, the intentional focus is high level discussion and research endeavors at the professorial level.  \nOther participants in WeBI are Corporate representatives.  The idea is for the professors to offer their latest research issues, promote discussions among the corporate participants to talk through the professors research and other research in the literature, as well as for the professors to listen for new areas for which commercial eBusinesses are seeking new research.\n\nAgain,  this is intentionally designed as a High Level Professor participation on the Wharton side, and high level e-Business Corporate executives on the other side. This is intentionally designed to create a high-level 'e-think-tank' environment for senior level professors and corporate executives.\n\nO.K.....have I labored enough to describe what WeBI is all about??\n\nAs opposed to the several other efforts Enron University Affairs has to DIRECTLY increase Enron's favorability and familiarity on campus at levels above recruiting, but that ultimately trickle down to recruiting, this is intentionally a research/discussion effort. Clearly, the Enron Brand equity in dealing with professors is that the professors ultimately incorporate work from information from the participatory forums into their class teachings, references, course work, etc. \n\nA few weeks ago, Louise and I breifly chatted about Enron's involvement in this effort.  Clearly, there is a HUGE interest by the Wharton professors and other corporate participants involved to have Enron attend and participate---they quite respectfully call me and eMail me very frequently.......All of this is very interesting to me and I have shepherded our minimal involvement-in-fact........ yet the question remains:  is there someone at Enron, directly involved in Enron's eBusiness initiatives, interested in jumping into this effort and participating?  Do those of you involved in these businesses think it worth your time and expense, or the time and expense of one of your senior (at least Director level) people to participate?  Would it be viewed, at least at this time,  simply as an \"Enron brain drain\" (I've received this realistic and possibly quite legitimate concern from more than one business person at Enron).   \n\nThe bottom line is, I'd like to be able to respond intelligently and honestly to those at Wharton committed to this effort.  I feel more than comfortable telling Wharton that, at this time, Enron is satisfied to participate in the WeBI effort largely at the \nfinancial level it has already invested--with the option to participate at other levels in the future, at Enron's discretion.\n\nALL comments solicited----\n\nMany thanks!!\n\n--Christie.\n\n\n\n\n\n---------------------- Forwarded by Christie Patrick/HOU/ECT on 05/21/2001 04:02 PM ---------------------------\n\n\nHartleyR <HartleyR@wharton.upenn.edu> on 05/21/2001 03:03:44 PM\nTo:\t\"'Christie_Patrick@enron.com'\" <Christie_Patrick@enron.com>\ncc:\t \n\nSubject:\tICG/Wharton Forum meeting May 31-June 1\n\n\nChristie,\n\nLee Goldring, our new Forum director mentioned that he placed a call to you\nto introduce himself and follow up on Enron's representation at the next\nmeeting.

Among other things, I'll be handling Northern Natural's compliance with the marketing affiliate rule. \n\nAn issue has come up with Northern as a result of the recent changes at Enron Corp.\n\nAndy Fastow is currently shown in the organizational chart on Northern Natural's electronic bulletin board as \"President, Northern Pipeline Sales Division\".  Apparently, he was named to this position because he was not an officer or director of one of our marketing affiliates and was also not an officer or director of Northern.

Frazier King suggested Cindy Olson, who also is neither an officer or director of a marketing affiliate nor an officer or director of Northern.

What is FERC's accounting position on the Exposure Draft related to Accounting for Certain Activities Related to Property, Plant, and Equipment, and is the FERC going to author a formal comment?\n\n2. With increased emphasis and regulation related to pipeline safety and integrity, it appears that a number of companies in the industry are embarking on significant programs to throughly test their systems. A significant aspect of a program of this nature is smart pigging and hydrostatic testing. What is the FERC's accounting position on possible capitalization of these costs? \n\n3. Of recent, the FASB has issued new rules, ie., SFAS 142 on Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, and SFAS 143  - Asset Retirement Obligations. Is the FERC going to issue regulatory accounting guidance on these new rules?\n\n4. \"GAAP\"-\"RAP\" differences has for some time been a informal topic of discussion. With increased FASB rulemaking activity this risk may be increasing. Since \"RAP\" is mandated by Federal Law has the FERC have any concerns that pipeline application of \"GAAP\" that may be deemed, at variance to \"RAP\" may also be violation of federal law? (ie., #1 above, and levelized rate making accounting, approved in rate settlements, but not \"approved\" for GAAP)\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Adams, Lynn [mailto:Lynn.Adams@ElPaso.com]\nSent: Tuesday, October 16, 2001 7:08 PM\nTo: 'jsaunde@enron.com'; 'nick.a.bacile@williams.com'; Wiederholt,\nPatricia; 'gwlefelar@cmsenergy.com'; 'gawolf@duke-energy.com';\n'susanne.w.harris@williams.com'; 'james.c.bourne@williams.com';\nHayslett, Rod; Cobb Jr., John\nSubject: FW: FERC/INGAA Accounting Liaison Meeting Agenda\n\n\n\n\n\n> I am working on the Agenda for the upcoming meeting on 10/25/01 and wanted\n> to see if anyone had any topics, issues, questions, etc. that he/she would\n> like for me to add.

The planned PV project has obtained a 50 percent PG&E rebate and will further reduce energy bills by $7500 a year. The projects will trim the district's on-peak and mid-peak energy use by 35 percent.\n\nSimple payback period for the microturbine project is 5.6 years and 9 years for the PV system.\n\nThe LA Community College District has requested a loan for over $436,000 to install a 140-kW PV system at its East Los Angeles College. The college has recently made lighting and comfort system improvements but would like to produce renewable energy to reduce energy costs by about $48,000 annually. Reduced energy bills will enable the District to pay back the loan in nine years.\n\nHumboldt officials will use about $130,000 in loans to improve heating and make lighting retrofits at the County courthouse and other buildings. Once done, the improvements will enable the county to reduce energy costs by at least $23,000 yearly. At the same time, the county will be able to reduce electrical consumption by 37 kilowatts. Savings from the projects alone will enable the county to repay the loan way ahead of the required 11-year payback period.\n\nThe loans were made under the Energy Conservation Assistance Act. To encourage energy efficiency, the act grants energy loans at a low 3 percent interest rate for local governments, schools from K-12, special districts, public and private care facilities, community college districts and other agencies.\n\n\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\nIf you would like to unsubscribe from this\nlist.

My dad had a good time as  \nwell.  He said it was the latest he has stayed out in a long time, and for a  \ngood reason.  He has such wonderful friends.   \n      I want to thank you for considering helping me in acheiving my goal  \nwhich is to get Laura Bush to speak at a fund raiser for our school.  The  \nevent will be in April; of course depending on her schedule this can change,  \nbut we have reserved the Snowmass Conference Center for the 19th.  This is a  \ngreat celebration for us and for education.  If you watch our video I am  \nsending for your viewing you will understand what we have been through just  \nto have the right to keep our doors open. We settled with Pitkin County  \nseveral years ago on a Supreme Court ruling by Judge Madge in our favor.  We  \nwere able to use those funds to build our current building.  We will be  \nmaking a new video for the gala that will include our high school.  The  \ncurrent video was made two years ago when we decided to embark upon high  \nschool.   \n      I know you understand the draw Mrs. Bush would have at such an event.   \nIt would be very meaningful for us if she could attend the celebration.  I  \nappreciate anything you could do that would encourage her to come.  I hope  \nyou and Linda will keep this time open on your busy schedules and attend.  We  \nare hoping to set into place endowment and educational chairs that will  \nsecure the future of our school. I may have mentioned our next endeavor we  \nsee in our future would be to open the school up for others across the  \ncountry to come and take advantage of the beautiful surroundings as well as  \nthe christian education.  We will have host families that will house the  \nstudents at first until we can absorb them perhaps as boarders.  We know God  \nis in charge and He will direct our path in this possibility. \n      I did not get the chance to also tell you how grateful we are as a  \nschool for Technology for All.  Our little school was the test pilot and the  \nfirst out of state set up and delivery.  Of course, I told them that if I had  \nto drive to Texas to get them I would and that is just what we did on one of  \nour Spring Breaks.  We loaded up a UHaul and drove 15 computers back to  \nBasalt for our state of the art computer lab.  We have a wonderful man who  \nhas networked them all  We are modem, cd rom and internet compatable now.  We  \nhave just received more for each of our high school classrooms from the   \noffice in Denver.  The fruit of your labor is prospering and we are so  \nthankful.  We probably have one of the best computer labs in the valley. \n      Thank you again for your consideration.  Please share the video with  \nLinda.  I know she will get a kick out of seeing William in action.  He truly  \nhas a gift at what he does.  We are proud to be a part of such wonderful  \nwork.  I will send the video today with some more info on the school.  Give  \nour regards to Bo and David.  We think of them often and always glad to see  \nthem when we do in Aspen.
