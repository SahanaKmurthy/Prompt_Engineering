# Prompt Engineering

## Overview
This repository contains assignments and projects completed for **17-630: Prompt Engineering**, a course offered at **Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) during Spring 2025**. The course focuses on designing and evaluating prompts for large language models (LLMs) and constructing reliable prompt-based systems.

## Course Information
- **Instructor**: Prof. Travis Breaux ([tdbreaux@andrew.cmu.edu](mailto:tdbreaux@andrew.cmu.edu))
- **Teaching Assistants**:
  - Venu Arvind Arangarajan ([varangar@andrew.cmu.edu](mailto:varangar@andrew.cmu.edu))
  - Neel Bhandari ([neelbhan@andrew.cmu.edu](mailto:neelbhan@andrew.cmu.edu))
  - Harivallabha Rangarajan ([hrangara@andrew.cmu.edu](mailto:hrangara@andrew.cmu.edu))
- **Class Schedule**: Tuesdays & Thursdays, 2:00 - 3:20 PM (3SC 265)
- **Units**: 12

## Learning Objectives
By the end of the course, students will be able to:
- Design effective prompt templates and instructions to guide LLM behavior.
- Develop multi-stage prompting strategies for complex tasks.
- Evaluate and optimize prompt designs through systematic experimentation.
- Understand prompt engineering techniques, including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), chain-of-thought prompting, and self-prompting for verification.

## Assignments
The repository includes implementations for the following assignments:
1. **In-Context Learning**: Evaluating instruction authoring, template design, and demonstrations for text classification.
2. **Tool Usage**: Comparing single-stage prompting vs. multi-stage task decomposition.
3. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Optimizing retrieval strategies for question answering and summarization.
4. **Prompt Composition**: Constructing structured prompts to improve model performance.

## Course Project
Students are required to propose and complete a final project involving advanced prompt engineering techniques. The project includes:
- Proposal submission.
- Biweekly progress reports.
- A final report and presentation.

## Tools & Resources
- **LLMs**: OpenAI's GPT, Google's Gemini, Anthropic's Claude.
- **Dataset Processing**: NLTK, sentence transformers.
- **Experiments & Evaluation**: Jupyter Notebook, Python.
- **Storage & Collaboration**: GitHub, SQLAlchemy (for database integration).
